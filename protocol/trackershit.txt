Tracker crypto functions:

Generate RSA Key Pair		yep
Save RSA Keypair as PEM		yep
Load PEM			yep
Maintain db of all connected rsa keys
Incoming traffic: Does this IP have an associated RSA key already?
			Decrypt traffic with our private key
				Is it valid HTTP request?
					Do what it says
				No
					Shit a dick nipple: (encrypted) "Not valid HTTP"
	
		If not, is this a valid 1024b RSA key?
		  If so, save IP:key tuple, send (encrypted) confirmation message "confirmed"
		  If not:
			Shit a dick nipple: "Invalid RSA key"

Outgoing traffic:
	Get pubkey of IP
		Encrypt outgoing HTML

Generate/store AES keys for new request (temp store of encryption key:decryption key)
Maybe: encrypt first connection request?
		for each peer

Non crypto shit (partial?):
	Find paths (average should be 2.71828)
	Generate tracking codes
		send (encrypted)
