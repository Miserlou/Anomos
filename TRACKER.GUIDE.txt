Guide to Running a Anomos Tracker
0.1

This document describes how to run an Anomos tracker.

Step 0 - Requirements

    An Anomos tracker must be TIGHTLY secured and managed by a compentant *nix 
system administrator. A tracker should be run on a dedicated *nix server with no
other internet-facing services other than secure, key-authenticated SSH. The 
server should run a stable distro and security patches should be applied 
regularly.

Step 1 - runtracker.sh

You will need a series of scripts to help run your tracker.

To get them:

git clone git://git.anomos.info/git/anomos-testing.git

And put this in a folder above your Anomos source tree. In this folder, there is
a script called runtracker.sh

Execute it like so:
./runtracker.sh

If it doesn't run properly, make sure that it is pointing to your anomos source
directory.

As this is your first time running the tracker, it will prompt you to answer
questions about your certificate. 
Make sure you answer these questions correctly.

Step 1 - Certificates

Answering the questions prompted by the script will produce a some new files in
the ./crypto folder. These are your certificates. Before other people can use
your tracker, you will need to have your certificates signed by CACert.org

To do this, you will first need to generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request).
In your crypto folder, type:

openssl req -new -key server-key.pem

    Answer the questions it asks, especially the Common Name field, which must
be your tracker's domain name. Once you've answered the questions, OpenSSL will
spit out a CSR to the standard output.

Log into CACert, and select "Server Certificates" on the right of the screen,
then select "new" and paste the CSR (including the ---BEGIN/END--- lines) into 
the text box and hit submit. CACert will then give you a new server certificate.
Make a backup of your old server-cert.pem and replace the contents of the 
server-cert.pem file with the signed certificate you got from CACert.

Now clients will be able to authenticate connections with you.
