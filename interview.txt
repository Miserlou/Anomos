BitTorrent is king of peer to peer filesharing at the moment. People
seem to really like the BitTorrent model for a number of reasons,
particularly ease, speed and sheer abundance, so that's what we've
decided to expand upon.

Anomos takes BitTorrent and combines it with the Onion Routing model
of Tor, but in a tracker-oriented way, with the added benefit of
end-to-end encryption. By doing this, we create a system whereby a
person can download a file from numerous sources anonymously, where
the uploader doesn't know where the download is going to, the routing
peers don't know what a file is or where it's destination is, and a
downloader doesn't know where a file originated from.

Governments and ISPs in lots of countries are conspiring against
internet users for fairly nefarious purposes, domestic surveillance
and copyright extortion. One of the worst examples of this is the UK's
3 strikes proposal:

I believe that open access to information is a fundamental right of
man and it needs to be protected.

We believe that open access to information is a fundamental right of
man and it needs to be protected. If people have important information
to share, they shouldn't have to worry about being punished for it.
For this reason, we created Anomos as a tool of free speech.

I've used Tor and FreeNet before, but unfortunately they both have
some implementation problems which makes them undesirable solutions
for the problem we're trying to solve.

Yes. We agreed very early on that unfortunately, some speed and CPU
power would have to sacrificed in the name of security. Pipes get
thicker and computers get faster, the important thing is that there is
a secure platform.

The first alpha release will be a complete proof of concept of the
protocol. Then we'll go through an extensive public and private
security audit before we start looking at release candidates.

Well, that depends. A person who wants to set up a tracker shouldn't
have to do anything different than the official BitTorrent tracker.

The link encryption and onion routing make the path and peer
connections very safe, assuming the implementation is sound. The
biggest threat to client anonymity is the amount of trust placed in
the tracker. Ultimately, we could enhance this trust using Hardware
Security Modules, but that's still in our future ideas box.

>   9) What are Anonmos' strengths?

Anomos is fast (as it uses multi-sourcing), ad-hoc, strongly
encrypted, pseudonymous, and easy to use as it is based on familiar
technologies.

In the comments of the blog coverage we've had so far, a lot of people
don't seem to recognize the difference between our model and just
running BT over Tor. In ours, the user's ratio is rewarded for
sharing, whereas for BitTorrent over Tor, they're punished in effect
for it.

Rich goes to Boston University and John goes to Hampshire College. We
are friends from high school.

We're both interested in the ideas of the Free Culture movement. I
(Rich) actually started the BU Free Culture chapter. Free Culture is a
bit different though, that is less to do with circumventing laws and
more to do with changing them or providing new options under existing
laws. My main goal with BUFC has nothing to do with filesharing but
with OpenCourseWare (see ocw.mit.edu).

Anomos is greek for Lawless. http://strongsnumbers.com/greek/459.htm

We talked about having a recursive acronym with a lot of clicking
sounds in it just because we liked the people idea of getting a lot of
white people to make clicking noises at each other but that name
didn't make the cut for some reason.
