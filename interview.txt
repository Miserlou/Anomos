BitTorrent is king of peer to peer filesharing at the moment. People
seem to really like the BitTorrent model for a number of reasons,
particularly ease, speed and sheer abundance, so that's what we've
decided to expand upon.

Anomos takes BitTorrent and combines it with the Onion Routing model
of Tor, but in a tracker-oriented way, with the added benefit of
end-to-end encryption. By doing this, we create a system whereby a
person can download a file from numerous sources anonymously, where
the uploader doesn't know where the download is going to, the routing
peers don't know what a file is or where it's destination is, and a
downloader doesn't know where a file originated from.

Governments and ISPs in lots of countries are conspiring against
Internet users for fairly nefarious purposes, domestic surveillance
and copyright extortion. One of the worst examples of this is the UK's
3 strikes proposal.

We believe that open access to information is a fundamental human right and it needs to be protected.

Plenty of folks! Whistle blowers, citizen journalists, people with limited freedom of speech/press, citizens of countries where the accusation of apostasy or sexual deviance could be life threatening, documentarians, mash-up artists. Anyone who feels their freedom may be unjustly threatened by their activities on the Internet.

Rich: I've used Tor and FreeNet before, but unfortunately they both have
some implementation problems which makes them undesirable solutions
for the problem we're trying to solve.
John: Over the past year I've done everything I can to familiarize myself with the field, and I'm confident that we know what we're doing. Of course we are students, not experts, so we're very interested in talking with other people who have worked on anonymizing protocols and applications before and having them examine our protocol.

Yes. We agreed very early on that unfortunately, some speed and CPU
power would have to sacrificed in the name of security. Pipes get
thicker and computers get faster, the important thing is that there is
a secure platform.

The first alpha release will be a complete proof of concept of the
protocol. Then we'll go through an extensive public and private
security audit before we start looking at release candidates.

Well, that depends. 
To connect to an Anomos tracker you're going to have to be using an Anomos
compatible client. The only change for the end user will be that, for now, they 
have to open their Anomos .torrents with a different program than they use for
BitTorrent. Similarly, someone running a tracker will see very little change.
If the protocol gets popular and people want to create alternative Anomos 
compatible Trackers or Clients, they'll have a bit of work set out for them. But
we're being sure to thoroughly document every part of the protocol to make the 
process as simple as possible.

The link encryption and onion routing make the path and peer
connections very safe, assuming the implementation is sound. The
biggest threat to client anonymity is the amount of trust placed in
the tracker. Ultimately, we could enhance this trust using a variety of methods, but that's still in our future ideas box.
We also know that, like all low-latency networks, we're vulnerable to traffic analysis. If an adversary suspects two individuals of communicating, and is capable of watching both of their connections, they may be able to break the anonymity. Such an attack would be extremely difficult for anyone to perform, but it is possible.

>   9) What are Anonmos' strengths?

Anomos is fast (as it uses multi-sourcing), ad-hoc, strongly
encrypted, pseudonymous, and easy to use.

In the comments of the blog coverage we've had so far, a lot of people
don't seem to recognize the difference between our model and just
running BT over Tor. In ours, the user's ratio is rewarded for
sharing, whereas for BitTorrent over Tor, they're punished in effect
for it.

Rich goes to Boston University and John goes to Hampshire College. We
are friends from high school.

We're both interested in the ideas of the Free Culture movement. I
(Rich) actually started the BU Free Culture chapter. My main goal with BUFC has nothing to do with filesharing but with OpenCourseWare (see ocw.mit.edu). 

Anomos is the epitome of a Free Culture project, it strongly encourages broader access to information, the preservation of civil liberties, and collaboration. 

>   11) How did you come up with the application's name?

We went through a bunch of names including some crazy ideas like recursive acronyms involving
clicking sounds, but eventually decided on using a Greek word relating to the project. The Greek for "anonymous" is something like "anonumos," but we shortened it to Anomos.. which happens to be the Greek word for Lawless. It works.

Thanks for your interest in the project!
