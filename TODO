TODO for .9:
    1) Finish Protocol Specification!: Path Generation, Hybrid Encryption
    2) Throw TCode generation into its own thread, or have a unique thread
        for each request (Much harder!)
    3) Solid round of bugtesting

    Also:
        Have some seeds on something we share! Dedicated seedbox!
        Better minion collections: Forum? WebIRC? Street Team?
        General: Update installation instructions, things like BUILD.windows.txt
        Client: Finish BitTorrent support -- is this still worth doing?
        Windows, Debian package (Niko?), OSX Build (Joao)


Switching to asyncore based SSL server:
    Replace all rawserver.listen_forever with asyncore.loop
    Replace all rawserver.create_ssl_serversocket with P2PServer(...)
    Delete all rawserver.start_listening
    Replace all rawserver.start_ssl_connection with P2PChannel(...)
    Kill the rawserver!
        Come up with solution for external_add_task/add_task
            This includes add/remove context
    Connection flushed?
