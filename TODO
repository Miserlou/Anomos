TODO:
    0) Switch to python's logging module so we can deploy on Planet-Lab and
       have each node log errors to our webserver
    1) Finish Protocol Specification!: Path Generation, Hybrid Encryption
    2) PartialMessageQueue max length and in turn a choking
        algorithm for relay nodes, so that they may signal that
        their PMQ is full. This requires testing.
    3) Solid round of bugtesting

    Also:
        Have some seeds on something we share! Dedicated seedbox!
        Better minion collections: Forum? WebIRC? Street Team?
        General: Update installation instructions, things like BUILD.windows.txt
        Client: Finish BitTorrent support -- is this still worth doing?
        Windows, Debian package (Niko?), OSX Build (Joao)
