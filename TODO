TODO for 1.0:
    0) Finish Protocol Specification
    1) Lots of testing
    2) Multi-torrent announce, POST method?
    3)  Dedicated tracker server. No other services, just hidden, key-authed SSH and tracker.anomos.info.
        This also means an established set of firewall rules and a good blocklist.
    4)  Multiple trackers/torrent. I don't know how difficult this will be yet - hopefully not too bad.
    [5:k-1]) Fix all of the bugs from .9.*
    k)   Debian package. Find a Deb/Ubu maintainer.
    k+1) Advertising. Bram used porn - I'm thinking this might actually be the way to go.
        Also, Stickers/Street team? Maybe we can trade stickers/merch for donations.
    k+2) Check all uses of sys.platform. Might explain cygwin problems
            http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.platform
    k+3) IPv6
