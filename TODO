TODO for .9:
    0) Non-blocking SSL connect!
    1) Checking tracker certs against stored certificates in addition
       to checking CA
    2) Finish Protocol Specification!: Path Generation, Hybrid Encryption
    3) Throw TCode generation into its own thread, or have a unique thread
        for each request (Much harder!)
    4) Solid round of bugtesting
    5) Check all uses of sys.platform. Might explain cygwin problems
            http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.platform

    Also:
        Have some seeds on something we share! Dedicated seedbox!
        Better minion collections: Forum? WebIRC? Street Team?
        General: Update installation instructions, things like BUILD.windows.txt
        Client: Finish BitTorrent support -- is this still worth doing?
        Windows, Debian package (Niko?), OSX Build (Joao)
	Hardening:	Move tracker.anomos.info to its own server
			shore/iptables rules
			blocklist
