TODO:
    0) Switch to python's logging module so we can deploy on Planet-Lab and
       have each node log errors to our webserver
    1) Finish Protocol Specification!: Path Generation, Hybrid Encryption
    2) Pause individual torrents in GUI
    3) PartialMessageQueue max length and in turn a choking
        algorithm for relay nodes, so that they may signal that
        their PMQ is full. This requires testing.
    4) Solid round of bugtesting
    5) Throw TCode generation into its own thread, or have a unique thread
        for each request (Much harder!)
    6) SOCKS support
    7) Solid round of bugtesting



    Also:
        Have some seeds on something we share! Dedicated seedbox!
        Better minion collections: Forum? WebIRC? Street Team?
        General: Update installation instructions, things like BUILD.windows.txt
        Client: Finish BitTorrent support -- is this still worth doing?
        Windows, Debian package (Niko?), OSX Build (Joao)
