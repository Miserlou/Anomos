TODO:
    1) **Finish Protocol Specification!**: Path Generation, Hybrid Encryption
    2) Requested torrent not found bug!
    3) Pause individual torrents in GUI
    4) PartialMessageQueue max length and in turn a choking
        algorithm for relay nodes, so that they may signal that
        their PMQ is full.
    5) Banning
    6) Solid round of bugtesting

    Also:
        Have some seeds on something we share! Dedicated seedbox!
        Better minion collections: Forum? WebIRC? Street Team?
        General: Update installation instructions, things like BUILD.windows.txt
        Client: Finish BitTorrent support
