TODO for .9:
    1) Finish Protocol Specification!: Path Generation, Hybrid Encryption
    2) Throw TCode generation into its own thread, or have a unique thread
        for each request (Much harder!)
    3) Solid round of bugtesting

    Also:
        Have some seeds on something we share! Dedicated seedbox!
        Better minion collections: Forum? WebIRC? Street Team?
        General: Update installation instructions, things like BUILD.windows.txt
        Client: Finish BitTorrent support -- is this still worth doing?
        Windows, Debian package (Niko?), OSX Build (Joao)
	Hardening:	Move tracker.anomos.info to its own server
			shore/iptables rules
			blocklist
