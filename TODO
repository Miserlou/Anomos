TODO:
    1) **Finish Protocol Specification!**: Path Generation, Hybrid Encryption
    2) Tracker side TCode generation is currently making a lot of duplicates
       Eliminate duplicate TCode generation and randomize paths a bit more.
       (particularly important for small networks)
    2.5) Need a better graph search algorithm.
    3) Multiple tracker support!
    4) Choking algorithm for relay nodes
    5) Solid round of bugtesting

    Also:
        Have some seeds on something we share! Dedicated seedbox!
        Better minion collections: Forum? WebIRC? Street Team?
        General: Update installation instructions, things like BUILD.windows.txt
        Client: Finish BitTorrent support
        Windows, Debian package
