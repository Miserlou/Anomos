TODO for .9:
    0) Cleanly remove streams from RateLimiter on stream shutdown (Use Dummy)
    1) Ask someone about the TCP RST flags we get occasionally
    2) Finish Protocol Specification!: Path Generation, Hybrid Encryption
    3) Throw TCode generation into its own thread, or have a unique thread
        for each request (Much harder!)
    4) Solid round of bugtesting
    5) Dedicated seeders for the first few days

TODO for 1.0:
    0)  Dedicated tracker server. No other services, just hidden, key-authed SSH and tracker.anomos.info.
        This also means an established set of firewall rules and a good blocklist.
    1)  Multiple trackers/torrent. I don't know how difficult this will be yet - hopefully not too bad.
    [2:k-1]) Fix all of the bugs from .9.*
    k)   Debian package. Find a Deb/Ubu maintainer.
    k+1) Advertising. Bram used porn - I'm thinking this might actually be the way to go. 
        Also, Stickers/Street team? Maybe we can trade stickers/merch for donations.
    k+2) Check all uses of sys.platform. Might explain cygwin problems
            http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.platform
