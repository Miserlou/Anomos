You will first need to do the following things:

Install Python, version 2.6 -
http://python.org/

Install the GTK 2.16 runtime (NOT 2.18!) -
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-win/

Install the latest PyGTK bundle -
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/

Install venster -
http://venster.sourceforge.net/htdocs/index.html

Install py2exe -
http://www.py2exe.org/

Install the nullsoft (NSIS) installer - 
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page

You will also need to have the installers described in /w32_dependancies/README.txt

In a shell, go to the root Anomos directory and run this command
python winsetup.py py2exe

This will create a folder called 'dist' which has the compiled exe.

rename anondownloadgui.exe to ANOMOS.exe

Move the directories /locale, /default_config and /default_certificates and their 
contents into the new /dist folder.

Now copy all the necessary GTK files from the GTK root installation
directory (usually c:\GTK\, see the GTK_BASEPATH environment
variable) into the dist directory. This includes the themes if you want it to look good.
You will also need to create a file called gtkrc in ./etc/gtk-2.0 with the line:
gtk-theme-name = "MS-Windows"

Now run NSIS on anomos.nsi using the highest-level available of 
compression, which is probably LZMA.

This will create an installer called Anomos-{VERSION}.exe
The installer is completely self-contained and will work on any 
Windows machine, even without the above software having been 
installed, including the dependancies.
