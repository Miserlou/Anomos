This is the folder for the dependancy installers required for the NSIS script.

These files won't be tracked in the git but anybody compiling a windows
installer package should put the following files into this directory:

MSVC++ Runtimes:
vcredist_x86.exe
(from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9B2DA534-3E03-4391-8A4D-074B9F2BC1BF)

Win32OpenSSL Light 0.9.8l:
Win32OpenSSL_Light-0_9_8l.exe
http://www.slproweb.com/download/Win32OpenSSL_Light-0_9_8l.exe

If we create a Anomos/Tor/Privoxy/Vidalia SuperBundle (which would be pretty sweet),
this is where those files would go as well.
